# Obsidian Review Plugin

[How to release obsidian plugin](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Release+your+plugin+with+GitHub+Actionsk)

## First time developing plugins?

Quick starting guide for new plugin devs:

-   Check if [someone already developed a plugin for what you want](https://obsidian.md/plugins)! There might be an existing plugin similar enough that you can partner up with.
-   Make a copy of this repo as a template with the "Use this template" button (login to GitHub if you don't see it).
-   Clone your repo to a local development folder. For convenience, you can place this folder in your `.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-name` folder.
-   Install NodeJS, then run `npm i` in the command line under your repo folder.
-   Run `npm run dev` to compile your plugin from `main.ts` to `main.js`.
-   Make changes to `main.ts` (or create new `.ts` files). Those changes should be automatically compiled into `main.js`.
-   Reload Obsidian to load the new version of your plugin.
-   Enable plugin in settings window.
-   For updates to the Obsidian API run `npm update` in the command line under your repo folder.

## Adding your plugin to the community plugin list

-   Check the [plugin guidelines](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Plugin+guidelines).
-   Publish an initial version.
-   Make sure you have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo.
-   Make a pull request at https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases to add your plugin.

## Manually installing the plugin

-   Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.

## Improve code quality with eslint (optional)

-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code to quickly find problems. You can run ESLint against your plugin to find common bugs and ways to improve your code.
-   To use eslint with this project, make sure to install eslint from terminal:
    -   `npm install -g eslint`
-   To use eslint to analyze this project use this command:
    -   `eslint main.ts`
    -   eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
-   If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder:
    -   `eslint .\src\`

## Funding URL

You can include funding URLs where people who use your plugin can financially support it.

The simple way is to set the `fundingUrl` field to your link in your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
	"fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com"
}
```

If you have multiple URLs, you can also do:

```json
{
	"fundingUrl": {
		"Buy Me a Coffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com",
		"GitHub Sponsor": "https://github.com/sponsors",
		"Patreon": "https://www.patreon.com/"
	}
}
```
